                <p>Apart from being a R&D manager, I enjoy my time to absorb new knowledge and learn new things. I also
                    plan to get following certifications in the half of this year.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    DP-203 : Microsoft Azure data scientist certification, designing and implementing an azure AI
                    solution.
                    <br>
                    Microsoft MCSA : SQL Database Adminstration certification.
                    <br>
                    Microsoft MCSA : SQL Database development certification.

                    <br>
                    Actually, AI is like a child. If you want to see AI is smart or not, there are some factors you can
                    check, like:
                    <br>
                    1. data analysis includes data digging & mining, data exploration, data correlation, etc...
                    <br>
                    2. feature engineering includes data cleaning, data imputaion, imbalance data processing, feature
                    selection, feature encode, feature scaling, etc...
                    <br>
                    3. model selection (the algorithm selection), model training, model scoring, model evaluation,
                    pridict, etc...
                    <br>
                    4. model deployment to let everyone use the model.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The reson why I plan to get data science related certifications in the end of this year is that:
                    <br>
                    1. data is important: I think the weighting of data is a large factor in AI. For example, if
                    imbalance data is fed, the learning result will be worse. It is hard to find any algorithm can solve
                    this problem unless you use SMOTE to process data and make it more balanced.
                    <br>
                    2. big data: Nowadays, there are many many huge ammount of data stream flow into the cloud every
                    moment. It is also important to know how to dig & process the correct data you want from big data.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After touching AI category, I found that AI is very chaming, fantasy and science fiction. I think AI
                    is now fast changing human life. I believe AI can do more things to improve our life. I feel that
                    now we stand on the shoulders of AI giants and then keep walking ahead. I expect I can contribute my
                    tiny distributions to human.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Family is also my favorite. Sometime, I enjoy my time to go outdoors with my family. We go to
                    movies, mountain hiking, biking on riverside, etc. I also expect to have delious food in night
                    market together with them. When being indoors, I enjoy my family time too. I enjoy to accompany my
                    two lovely children when they study their school works.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I think AI enrich my life. I am as sponge and I expect I can absorb new knowledge as possible as I
                    can. Thus, I join the online course of deep learning course and database course at night of weekdays
                    or Sunday.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In my spare time, I learn web front end capability. It is really funny to make my own web-site. And
                    it is very wonderful if I make a little bit better in your web-site.
