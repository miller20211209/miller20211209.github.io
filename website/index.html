                <p> I am experienced and interested in machine learning, deep learning, data science,
                    azure cloud service (azure machine learning service, ML Ops, azure bot service and cognitive
                    services).
                    <br>
                    Now I already got two Microsoft certifications,
                </p>

                    Python is now the mainly stream programming language in the world. (Please reference: <a
                        href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank">TIOBE</a>
                    ) The reason why it so popular is nothing more than: simple and
                    easy to learn. The most important is that there are so many various powerful packages to support it
                    and to make it more and more popular, especially in machine learning and deep learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For machine learning, I study the textbook “Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-learn book --
                    Sebastian”. From the book, we can define machine learning steps as followings:
                </p>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li>Data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering & dimensionality reduction </li>
                    <li>splitting dataset into train data and test data </li>
                    <li>train data combine with algorithms </li>
                    <li>generating train model </li>
                    <li> model scoring </li>
                    <li> re-train model </li>
                    <li> model evaluation </li>
                    <li> model prediction & model deployment </li>
                </ul>
                <p>They are explained as follows: </p>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li>Data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering & dimensionality reduction:</li>
                    <ul type="circle">
                        <li>Data exploration & data cleaning: (focus on the data content)</li>
                        <ul type="disc">
                            <li>Visualization data: Use bar charts, histograms, kernel density plot, seaborn, scatter
                                plot, deal with overplotting, desity-2d plot, box plot, violin plot to know the
                                relationship between features and to figure out the possible problem in data.</li>
                            <li>Data cleaning: Data cleaning for the missing values and duplicated rows. Transform the
                                column data type. Process the imbalanced data, recode the column names, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Feature engineering: (focus on the data features)</li>

                            <li>Use one hot encoding to transform categorical features (ordinal features or nominal
                                features).</li>
                            <li>Feature scaling (normalization or standardization), transform date code, regularization

                        </ul>
                        <li>Dimensionality reduction: The purpose is to reduce the complexity of the model and avoid
                            overfitting. From the other viewpoint, the data size is reduced but the data information is
                            same. The methods are feature selection and feature extraction which explain as following:
                        </li>

                            <li>Feature selection: Two ways to get features importance, SBS and Random Forest.</li>
                            <li>Feature extraction: There are three ways, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), LDA
                                (Linear Discriminant Analysis), Kernel PCA.</li>
                        </ul>

                                can choose the proper algorithm solve certain problem. Or if you don’t how to choose,
                                pipeline or ensemble learning together with grid search CV method can help you to find
                                the “best” algorithm.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Performance tuning:</li>
                    <ul type="circle">
                        <li>Using grid search CV to find out optimal hyperparameters combinations. (Spending money to
                            buy time.)</li>
                        <li>Using pipeline to simplify code and easy to tune hyperparameters. To find the best
                            performance.</li>
                        <li>K-fold cross-validation/Holdout cross validation: to avoid the sample data to influence
                            model performance.</li>
                        <li>Regularization L1 & L2: to solve overfitting problems.</li>
                        <li>Overall speaking, using pipeline is for tuning hyperparameter. After tuning hyperparameter,
                            we want to make use of k-fold to avoid possibility of sampling data influencing model
                            result. Another factor also affects model performance is imbalance data. For this case,
                            something we can do:</li>
                        <ul type="disc">
                            <li>Try to get more data.</li>
                            <li>Change performance index, for example, accuracy or loss is not so important to
                                imbalanced data. We can change to use confusion matrix index, like precision, recall.
                                (so-called f1-score).</li>
                            <li>SMOTE: Dropping certain proportion of the majority data and increasing the minority data
                                size by using normal distribution, something like that random forest. Using SMOTE to
                                make the data more balanced.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Performance index:</li>
                    <ul type="circle">
                        <li>Confusion metrics: The indicators in common use are: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score,
                            sensitivity.</li>
                        <li>AUC/ROC:</li>
                        <ul type="disc">
                            <li>ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic): Based on each decision threshold, to compare the
                                change between true positive rate and false positive rate.</li>
                            <li>AUC (Area Under the Curve): the larger area of AUC is the better performance of model.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Ensembling Learning: We can use many classification methods by using ensemble classifier. Four
                        methods of ensemble learning:</li>
                    <ul type="circle">
                        <li>Majority Voting: the majority voting can win the prediction.</li>
                        <li>Bagging: Resample with replacement to generate enough bootstrap samples. Increase new data
                            to enhance and modify the bootstrap data by using normal distribution.</li>
                        <li>Boosting: Focus on hard classified sample and learn from error judgement. Amplify the weak
                            part during learning process and expect to get better performance.</li>
                        <li>Adaboost (Adaptive Boosting): Use full sample for training and make bigger weighting for
                            error judgement sample. Retrain the model.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>For deep learning, I study “Pyorch 開發者傳授祕笈 --- 陳昭明”. I earn a lot from that book. When I do the
                    PyTorch practice, I do the comparison to TensorFlow to understand the advantage and disadvantage of
                    the two packages. My personal point of view, PyTorch is more suitable than TensorFlow in deep
                    learning by using Python. TensorFlow version update frequency is too fast. It means the application
                    you implement in TensorFlow might not be work in the latest version. Usually, you need to take
                    effort to modify for that.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In deep learning, the CNN (convolution neural network) is basic neural network but it is the most
                    important. Simply speaking, CNN use image processing technology to extract image features and
                    abstract gradually. We can treat CNN as convolution + pooling layers + fully connected layers +
                    binary classifications. To reduce computing power, there are some assumptions in CNN.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Same as Scikit-learn, if you want to get good results, there are many details that need to be
                    process. For CNN, there are many checkpoints you need to notice, such as input images, convolution
                    setting, filter setting, pooling, flatten, activation function, feature extraction, pooling layer,
                    computing power, confusion matrix. (You can reference my works from website <a
                        href="https://github.com/miller20211209/upload" target="_blank">
                        My Works </a> )</p>
                <br>
                <p>Sometimes, I also learn the newest AI technology from internet, such as website paperwithcode, GPT3,
                    openAI, etc. Consider the paper quantity on paperwithcode, PyTorch is more and more popular than
                    TensorFlow. In recently, the headline is the YOLO v7 won the COCO competition again. No doubt, if
                    you have object detection, YOLO v7 is the best choice because YOLO v7 surpasses all known object
                    detectors in both speed and accuracy in the range from 5 fps to 160 fps. It is amazing and good
                    enough. I hope I can try to simulate YOLO v7 and put it on my website as one of my works in the
                    following moths. (Please reference website <a
                        href="https://paperswithcode.com/paper/yolov7-trainable-bag-of-freebies-sets-new"
                        target="_blank"> YOLO v7 </a> )</p>
                <br>
                <p>In order to get pass certifications, I also study Microsoft Azure MLOps structure, mechanism and
                    device. Fortunately, I got the certifications and got good scores. I also take some time to be
                    familiar with Azure DevOps. The concept of Aure DevOps is similar with Git but its UI is more
                    attractive. But you need to pay attention to your money. When you want to create free trial but set
                    the wrong choice, the cost will accumulate little by little everyday under your eyes. Azure DevOps
                    provide CICD and make your team more efficiency.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Apart from being a R&D manager, I enjoy my time to absorb new knowledge and learn new things. I also
                    plan to get following certifications in the half of this year.</p>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li> DP-203 : Microsoft Azure data scientist certification, designing and implementing an azure AI
                        solution.</li>
                    <li> Microsoft MCSA : SQL Database Adminstration certification.</li>
                    <li> Microsoft MCSA : SQL Database development certification.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Actually, AI is like a child. If you want to see AI is smart or not, there are some factors you can
                    check, like:
                    <br>
                    1. data analysis includes data digging & mining, data exploration, data correlation, etc...
                    <br>
                    2. feature engineering includes data cleaning, data imputaion, imbalance data processing, feature
                    selection, feature encode, feature scaling, etc...
                    <br>
                    3. model selection (the algorithm selection), model training, model scoring, model evaluation,
                    pridict, etc...
                    <br>
                    4. model deployment to let everyone use the model.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The reson why I plan to get data science related certifications in the end of this year is that:
                    <br>
                    1. data is important: I think the weighting of data is a large factor in AI. For example, if
                    imbalance data is fed, the learning result will be worse. It is hard to find any algorithm can solve
                    this problem unless you use SMOTE to process data and make it more balanced.
                    <br>
                    2. big data: Nowadays, there are many many huge ammount of data stream flow into the cloud every
                    moment. It is also important to know how to dig & process the correct data you want from big data.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After touching AI category, I found that AI is very chaming, fantasy and science fiction. I think AI
                    is now fast changing human life. I believe AI can do more things to improve our life. I feel that
                    now we stand on the shoulders of AI giants and then keep walking ahead. I expect I can contribute my
                    tiny distributions to human.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Apart from AI, family is also my favorite. Sometime, I enjoy my time to go outdoors with my family.
                    We go to
                    movies, mountain hiking, biking on riverside, etc. I also expect to have delious food in night
                    market together with them. When being indoors, I enjoy my family time too. I enjoy to accompany my
                    two lovely children when they study their school works.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I think AI enrich my life. I am as sponge and I expect I can absorb new knowledge as possible as I
                    can. Thus, I join the online course of deep learning course and database course at night of weekdays
                    or Sunday.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In my spare time, I learn web front end capability. It is really funny to make my own web-site. And
                    it is very wonderful if I make a little bit better in your web site.
